            <p>Welcome to my little piece of the web. Get comfortable while I tell you a little about who I am.</p>
            <p>My name is Melissa Day. I am a Freelance Photographer with a background in Anthropology and Peace Studies. I have a slight obsession with traveling to new places and experiencing new cultures. Throughout the years I have backpacked along the Continental Divide, rafted down roaring rivers, jumped from a perfectly good airplane, sailed aboard a floating hospital to deliver aid to an African nation rich in culture, broken bread with a family in a small village in Sierra Leone in which the largest barrier was language and spent a night combing the seas with local fisherman along the coast of Ecuador. I could go on, but you get the point.  I like to challenge myself by pushing on the border of my ever expanding comfort zone.</p>  
            <p>My experiences have opened my mind and broadened my creativity. 
            I am hoping to use what I have learned so far to deep dive into the world of web developing. So pull up a chair and stay for a while.
            </p>
